This is a Shiny App using the mtcars dataset distributed with the basic R distribution. The App allows the user to select the variable for both the X and Y Axis by selecting them from the widget on the left hand sidebar. In addition the user can also define a third variable from the factor variables in the matcars dataset to be used to color the points in the scatter plot again from a widget in the sidebar. The plot also fits a regession line of the X variable onto the Y variable. 

The mtcars data set contains the following variables:
```
mpg   - Miles per Gallon
cyl   - Number of Cylinders in the Engine 
disp  - Displacement of the Engine (cu.in.)
hp    - Gross Horsepower
drat  - Rear Axil Ratio
wt    - Weight (lb/1000)
qsec  - Time in the Quarter Mile
v/s   - V/S
am    - Transmission (0=Automatic, 1=Manual)
gear  - Number of Gears
carb  - Number of Carburators
```
Using these selections the user can easily explore this data set and gain a basic understanding of the relationship between the variables.
